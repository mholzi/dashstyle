/*
  DashStyle Custom Stylesheet

  While most of the core component styles are defined directly within dashstyle.js
  to ensure they are correctly encapsulated in the Shadow DOM, this file can be
  used for loading custom fonts, defining broad CSS variables, or for styles
  that you might want to link externally.

  For the current version, this file is not strictly required for the dashboard
  to function, but it is included to provide a clean structure for future enhancements.
